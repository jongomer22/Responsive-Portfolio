<p>I am an aspiring full stack web developer looking to get into the tech industry and eventually become a software engineer, and one day CTO of a major tech company. I am hard working, have great time management, will always see a task through no matter the challenge, I work well on a team as well as on individual assignments, and I am a very motivated person. </p>

<p>I am fluent in HTML5, CSS & Bootstrap, Javascript and Jquery, GitHub, and have the ability to use the wide range of resources available to get what I need done. I also am a very quick learner. I studied full stack web development at the University of Cal Berkeley</p>

<p>I currently reside in the north bay but am more than willing to commute if the right opportunity arises. I am eager to get to work and contribute to a team immedietely.</p>
